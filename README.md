# AstroVisualization
This repo provides examples and resources for creating visualization for astro (scientific) data. 

- Create images/videos with Blender:
  - [Blender environment setup](#blender-environment-setup)
  - [Particle Data (For small data set)](#particle-data-for-small-data-set)
    - Also useful for know how to script in blender
  - [Density field data](#density-field-data)
  - [Other useful things to look up](#other-useful-things-to-look-up)
- Create interactive data experience on website with three.js
   - ... to be added

## Blender environment setup
1. Install Blender 
    * https://www.blender.org/
2. To use other Python library (such as pandas ) in Blender, you need to use the Python executable under the Blender folder.
    * Find the location where you install Blender. (E.g. I used the default path which is "C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender 3.6\")
    * Find the python.exe under [version_number]/python/bin
    * Right click python.exe file and select "Open in terminal"
    * In the terminal type 
        ```
        .\python.exe -m pip install [package name]
        ```
    * For example, using my path to install pandas in PowerShell would be 
        ```
        PS C:\Program Files\Blender Foundation\Blender 3.6\3.6\python\bin> .\python.exe -m pip install pandas
        ```    
## Particle Data (For small data set)
Particle data is common in astronomical simulations.

Usually, they contains the position information of particles along with related other properties (such as mass, velocity...) as the following:
| Position.x  | Position.y | Position.z | Property 1 | Property 2|
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| ... | ... | ... |...| ... |

### Create particle visualization with Python scripting in Blender

This is suitable for people who are used to python programming experience but are overwhelmed by the thousands buttons in 3D softwares. 

#### Start creating particles in Blender
1. Open Blender and create a new "General" file
    ![alt text](/Pictures/Create.png)
2. Click on the cube in the center of the view and hit delete.
3. On the top banner, select "Scripting" tab.
    ![alt text](/Pictures/ScriptTab.png)
4. Click on "+ New" to create a new script.
5. Import libraries
    ```
    # This is the library for Blender
    import bpy

    # Import other library as needed
    import pandas as pd
    ```
6. The following sciprt shows an example of using a particle file to create small cubes in blender:
    ```
    df = pd.read_csv("file_path")
    for index, row in df.iterrows():
        bpy.ops.mesh.primitive_cube_add(size = 0.1, location=(row['x'],row['y'],row['z']))

    ```
7. Select the "Layout" tab in the top banner and you should see the cubes being created.
    * For example, if my data file is 
        ```
        x,y,z
        1,0,0
        2,0,0
        3,0,0
        0,1,0
        0,2,0
        0,3,0
        ```
    * You will be able to see the following in the view port:

## Density field data

Density field data is another common data format people can use to create good visualization.

Usually, they are represented as arrays in x\*x\*x shape where x is resolution of the field.

### Create density field visualization with Python scripting in Blender
[The example script](/BlenderExamples/DensityFeildVis.py) should be mostly self-explanatory with detailed comments. Basically, we use [OpenVDB](https://www.openvdb.org/) convert our density field data into vdb files which is commonly used in 3D softwares to visualize complex objects like clouds, smoke and file.

#### Start creating particles in Blender
1. Open Blender and create a new "General" file
2. Navigate to the Scripting workspace from the top menu.
3. Open the script file by selecting File -> Open and navigating to the script's location, or simply paste [the example script](/BlenderExamples/DensityFeildVis.py) into a new text block.
4. Press Run Script to execute.
5. ** If this does not make sense to you, see more detail with images from above.

There is also an example blender file you can play around with. If you use the default script and data, you should see the following in Blender:
